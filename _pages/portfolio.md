Research
======

My research interest includes the following areas.

**Educational Data Mining**: Studies in this area mainly focus on mining large-scale educational datasets using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.
* **Project 1 (Completed in 2022)**:
  This project mined the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) data to explore potential predictors for low socioeconomic status high school students' college enrollment. In this study, we selected malleable factors based on Ecological System Theory and used machine learning techniques, such as random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression to predict low socioeconomic status high school students' college enrollment status. Findings from this project have been published in the 2023 AERA meeting ([Download Slides](files/04_2023AERAHS.pdf)
  
* **Project 2**: Mining the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 to explore the role of discrepancy between self-reported and response-time-based questionnaire-taking motivation on Canadian students' test achievements.

**Learning Analytics**:  
* **Project 1**: Examining the change in college students' self-regulated learning patterns after a formative assessment.
* **Project 2**: Examining preschool children's planning and problem-solving pattern
* 

**Computational Psychometric**:
* **Project 1**: Systematic review of the use of process data in computer-based assessments
* **Project 2**: Assessing Collaborative problem-solving based on communicational data


**Educational Expectations**:
* **Project 1**: The developmental trajectory of primary children's educational expectations
* **Project 2**: The role of the discrepancy between mothers and children's educational expectations on children's well-being
