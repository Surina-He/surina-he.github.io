# Research Areas

## 1. Educational Data Mining: 
Studies in this area mainly focus on mining large-scale educational datasets using advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques.

### Project 1 (Completed): 
This project mined the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) data.
  * **_Study 1 (PI: Surina He)_**: In this study, we selected malleable factors based on Ecological System Theory and used machine learning techniques, such as random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression to predict low socioeconomic status high school students' college enrollment status. Findings from this project have been published in the 2023 AERA meeting ([Download Slides](files/04_2023AERAHS.pdf)).
  * **_Study 2 (PI: Dr. Okan Bulut)_**: In this study, we predicted high school students' school dropout from human-machine collaboration perspective. We applied random forest, deep learning, and Explainable AI (XAI) methods to identify potential predictors of high school dropout. Findings from this study have been published in the 2023 NCME meeting ([Download Slides](files/08_2023NCMEHW.pdf)) and *Discover Education* ([Download Paper](files/Paper12DroupOut.pdf)).
  * **_Study 3 (PI: Tarid Wongvorachan)_**: In this study, we compared several sampling techniques to handle the different ratios of the
class imbalance problem (i.e., moderately or extremely imbalanced classifications). For our comparison, we used random oversampling
(ROS), random undersampling (RUS), and the combination of the synthetic minority oversampling technique for nominal and continuous (SMOTE-NC) and RUS as a hybrid resampling technique. Findings from this study have been published in *Information* ([Download Paper](files/Paper8Undersampling.pdf)).
  
### Project 2 (Ongoing, PI: Surina He): 
This project mined the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 data. We mainly explored the role of the discrepancy between self-reported and response-time-based questionnaire-taking motivation on Canadian students' test achievements. We used Response Behavior Effort (RBE) as an indicator of students' response-time-based motivation and applied the Response Surface Analysis (RSA) method to analyze the data. The findings from this study are under review.

## 2. Learning Analytics: 
Studies in this area mainly focus on using log data to explore students' learning behaviors and patterns in digital learning platforms, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS).

### Project 1 (Completed, PI: Surina He): 
This project examined the changes in college students' self-regulated learning patterns after a formative assessment, with a special focus on comparing changes in low-performing and high-performing students. We analyzed log data from the University's Learning Management Systems using process mining techniques, such as Fuzzy Miner and pMiner. Findings from this project have been published in *Computers in Human Behavior* ([Download Paper](files/Paper9SelfRegulatedLearning.pdf)).
  
### Project 2 (Ongoing, PI: Surina He, Funded by the Alberta Graduate Excellence Scholarship): 
This project examined the role of preschool children's planning time on their problem-solving performances across tasks with different difficulty levels. This project used the mobile log data from the Intelligent Tutoring Systems, which was designed by a Chinese Educational Technology Company. We used Moderated Generalized Linear and Logistic Regression as our main statistical models. Findings from this project are under review.  

## 3. Computational Psychometric:
* **Project 1**: Systematic review of the use of process data in computer-based assessments
* **Project 2**: Assessing Collaborative problem-solving based on communicational data


## Educational Expectations:
* **Project 1**: The developmental trajectory of primary children's educational expectations
* **Project 2**: The role of the discrepancy between mothers and children's educational expectations on children's well-being
