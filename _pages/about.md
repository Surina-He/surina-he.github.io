I am a Ph.D. student in the Measurement, Evaluation, and Data Science program at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/educational-psychology/graduate-programs/measurement-evaluation-and-data-sciences/index.html). I earned my B.S. degree from [Faculty of Psychology](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/schoolsdepartments/byx/113270.htm) and my M.Ed. degree from [Collaborative Innovation Centre of Assessment for Basic Education Quality](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/schoolsdepartments/yjs/113323.htm) in Beijing Normal University. I was a visiting student in the [Department of Psychology](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/about.html) at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) and [National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST)](https://cresst.org/about-us/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. I also served as a statistical consultant at the [Centre for Research in Applied Measurement and Evaluation (CRAME)](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/crame/crame-consultants?authuser=0) and [Thinking Historically â€“ For Canada's Future project](https://thinking-historically.ca/consultants/).

My research focuses on educational data mining, learning analytics, and computational psychometrics. I am particularly interested in analyzing temporal data, such as longitudinal time-series data and computer log data, to explore students' behavioral patterns, motivation, and higher-order cognitive processes during learning and test-taking. Given the complexity of these datasets, I am also keen on applying advanced statistical and AI-driven techniques to uncover meaningful insights. My work aims to inform personalized educational interventions and contribute to a deeper understanding of how students engage and perform over time.
