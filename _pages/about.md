  Welcome to My Website

I am a Ph.D. student in the Measurement, Evaluation, and Data Science (MEDS) program at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/educational-psychology/graduate-programs/measurement-evaluation-and-data-sciences/index.html). I earned my B.S. degree from [Faculty of Psychology](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/schoolsdepartments/byx/113270.htm) and my M.Ed. degree from [Collaborative Innovation Centre of Assessment for Basic Education Quality](https://english.bnu.edu.cn/schoolsdepartments/yjs/113323.htm) in Beijing Normal University. I was a statistical consultant at the [Centre for Research in Applied Measurement and Evaluation (CRAME)](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/crame/crame-consultants?authuser=0) and [Thinking Historically â€“ For Canada's Future project](https://thinking-historically.ca/consultants/). I also served as a principal instructor for a graduate-level course [EDPY 505 Quantitative Method I](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/edpy/505), as well as as a teaching assistant for one undergraduate-level course [EDPY 303 Educational Assessment](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/edpy/303), and two graduate-level courses [EDPY 605 Quantitative Method II](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/edpy/605) and [EDPY 502 Educational Data Mining](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/edpy/502) in University of Alberta.

My research focuses on educational data mining, learning analytics, and computational psychometrics. I am particularly interested in exploring temporal data, such as longitudinal time-series data and computer log data, to investigate students' behavioral patterns, motivation, and complex cognitive processes during learning and test-taking. Given the complexity of these datasets, I am also keen on applying advanced statistical and AI-driven techniques, such as process mining, dynamic Bayesian models, and psychometric network analysis, to uncover meaningful insights. Some of these studies have been published in well-recorded journals such as Contemporary Educational Psychology and Computers in Human Behavior, and well-known conferences like the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). You can find out more about the research projects I contribute on the Research page.
